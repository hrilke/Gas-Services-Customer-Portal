## Learnings
- Understanding MVT Architecture: Learned how Django implements the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture with models for data handling, views for processing user requests, and templates for rendering HTML pages.

- Database Integration: Gained experience in integrating and managing databases using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), including defining models, migrations, and querying data.

- Views and URL Routing: Practiced defining views and mapping them to URLs using Django's URL routing mechanism, ensuring proper routing of user requests to appropriate view functions.
